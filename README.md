The main purpose of this repository is to store my tasks completed and in progress from codewars.com. Each class corresponds to one task from the site, each class is sorted in folders according to the difficulty level of the task according to the site. The levels are from kyu 8(the easiest, foundations of programming) ending with kyu 1(the most difficult ) tasks. The assignments are written exclusively by me, although they are not perfect.
